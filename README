Overview
============================================================
This is a set of scripts and configurations I use to create code navigation
databases for use with Vim. They require Exhuberant ctags[0] and id-utils[1].
The Vim plugin lid.vim[2] is useful for the id-utils integration.

Installation
============================================================
Installation is easy. Simple copy/link ctagsrc to ~/.ctagsrc and place tags.sh
into an appropriate directory in your $PATH.

Usage
============================================================

Make_system_tags.sh
--------------------------------------------------
Make_system_tags.sh is a script which creates a ctags database from the system
headers. If you are writing programs where you use the system headers much I
recommend running it once. It will create the file ~/.tags for all the system
headers. This is most useful for C and C++.

tags.sh
--------------------------------------------------
You can use tags.sh in one of two ways. The first is 'tags.sh .' which creates
the ctags and id-utils databases for the current directory and all the
subdirectories.

The second way is to fill all the directories you wish to produce databases for
in the file ~/.projects. The format of this file is one project per line:

project_path [ignore_dir1 [ignore_dir2 [ ... ]]]

That is, when called like 'tags.sh' every line in ~/.projects represents a
project or checkout. All the subdirectories except the ones listed after the
first directory of the line, will be included in the database created. Excluded
directories will be excluded. Many version control directories are automatically
excluded.

It is safe and convenient, on larger projects, to run tags.sh while using an
existing database. A new database will be created with the most up to date
information and then moved into place when complete. This way you can use a
slightly out-of-date navigation database until the new one is finished being
created.
